# Documentation of our DLS project.

In our DLS project, we have created documentation for each of the microservices + also an overall documentation of how to run the actual application.
This is done though readme files. 

furthermore we have utilized Swagger for api documentation. This ensures that the list of endpoints are shown and updated to the newest state, since 
the package automaticly generates these swagger.json files from the most recent code.
